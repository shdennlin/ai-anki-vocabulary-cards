## üÜò Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues

**Q: The AI didn't generate a CSV file**  
A: Make sure you copied the entire prompt. Some AIs need you to explicitly ask for the download link.

**Q: My cards look plain/ugly**  
A: Double-check that you copied the CSS from `style.css` into Anki's "Styling" section.

**Q: Some fields are empty**  
A: This is normal! Not every word has antonyms or multiple examples. Empty fields won't show on your cards.

**Q: I want to change the colors/design**  
A: Edit the `style.css` file! The colors are defined at the top with variables like `--accent` and `--bg-card`.

### FAQ

**Can I use this for other languages?**  
Yes! Just modify the AI prompt to generate cards for your target language.

**Do I need to pay for AI access?**  
Most AI tools have free tiers that work great for this. ChatGPT's free version works fine.

**How many words can I process at once?**  
Start with 10-20 words. Very long lists might overwhelm the AI or hit token limits.

**Can I customize the fields?**  
Absolutely! Modify both the AI prompt and the Anki templates to match your learning style.
